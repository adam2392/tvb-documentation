TVB for MATLAB
--------------

This is the MATLAB interface for TVB, a neuroimaging modeling tool built
in Python. It uses MATLAB's recent support for Python, so you'll need at
least 2014b.

This toolbox is currently experimental as we test across platforms. Please
send any crash reports, suggestions or complaints to 
mwoodman@thevirtualbrain.org.

To get started, please use the tvb_setup function, and start exploring
the demos, named tvb_demo_*.
